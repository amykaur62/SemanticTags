      <p>Mexico is a great place to visit for first timers and adventure seekers alike.</p>
    
      <p>Mexico is great for kids, teens and adults as everyone can find something to do in this cultural country.  There are numerous things to do, to see, to try.  Mexico waters are crystal blue and a great sight to wake up to every morning.  Whether for pleasure or business, Mexico has been a great tourist spot for many and I'm glad to have made the trip this past summer to experience everything first hand.</p>
    
      <p>This page includes important resources that I looked at to plan my perfect trip.</p>
